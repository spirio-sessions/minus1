Tutorial for the Million Song Dataset

This tutorial will walk you through a quick experiment
using the Million Song Dataset (MSD). We will actually be working
on the 10K songs subset for speed issues, but the code should
transpose seamlessly.

In this tutorial, we do simple metadata analysis. We look at
which artist has the most songs by iterating over the whole
dataset and using an SQLite database.

You need to have the MSD code downloaded from GITHUB.
See the MSD website for details:
http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/

If you have any questions regarding the dataset or this tutorial,
please first take a look at the website. Send us an email
if you haven't found the answer.

Note: this tutorial is developed using Python 2.6
      on an Ubuntu machine. PDF created using 'pyreport'.
