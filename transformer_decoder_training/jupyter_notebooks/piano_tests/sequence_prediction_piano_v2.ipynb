    "- Die Töne, die gespielt werden passen musikalisch nicht gut zusammen\n",

    "Potentielle Ursachen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ich mache sehr wahrscheinlich einen Fehler beim Training mit memory und Target, da beim Decoder only ja der output vom letzten Step an den output angehängt und als input für den nächsten step verwendet wird. -> Autoregressiv\n",

Aber ich brauche ja die linke hand (+ evtl. rechte hand als input) -> und muss die Rechte hand vorhersagen. wie ist das dann mit der Vorhersage von nur der linken hand? -> oder doch lieber ganze sequenz vorhersagen \n",
    "- Der Decoder only Transformer generiert normalerweise nur 1 Token auf einmal -> ich habe evtl falschen Ansatz\n",
    "- Ich mache generell irgendwo einen Fehler in der Transformerstruktur\n",
    "- Das training passt nicht für einen Encoder-decoder Only -> Ich mache ja nicht wirklich eine sequentielle vorhersage sondern versuche quasi eher eine Übersetzung -> von rechter auf linke hand\n",
    "- Die Snapshots müssen irgendwie anders tokenized werden. -> in allen textgenerierungstasks ist die eingabesquenz vor dem embedding geringer -> nur zahlen anstatt einem Vektor -> evtl. eigenen Tokenizer schreiben?\n",
    "- **Keine eigene Kostenfunktion**\n",
    "- inferenz muss anders gemacht werden\n",
    "- Ist sigmoid-funktion im forward schritt wirklich notwendig oder am besten erst ganz am schluss"
